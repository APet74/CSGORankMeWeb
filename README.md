Web interface for Rank Me CSGO Stat tracking plugin

# Purpose
This web interface is to allow users to view the stats from Counter Strike Global Offensive servers running the RankMe plugin found <a href='https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?p=1456869'>Here</a>

# Features
<ul>
<li>Sort by various stats, kills, time, headshots, points or any other tracked stat.</li>
<li>Check your personal stats from any of the servers running RankMe</li>
<li>Check stats of any player you desire that plays on the server(s) you are looking for.</li>
</ul>

# Ideas
<ul>
<li>Page for all database strings as functions so then when you need to get data from database you just call the function and use the returned data.  For instance, getTotalPlayrNumber() would select all player records from the player table and count them and return that number</li>
 
<li>XML file for database connection info so that you can edit it later VIA either an admin page (probably) or editing the file.</li>
 
<li>Searches for players by name or SteamID  (Automate with steamID converter to check various forms)</li>
 
<li>Leaderboards that are sortable by any stat (Use querys above to get that info AJAX+Pagination)</li>
 
<li>Live server stats (Map, players, players stats, connect button)</li>
 
<li>mySQL only?</li>
</ul>

# Installation
